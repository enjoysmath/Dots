### About the name
"..." otherwise known as ellipses or "dots" are prolific in math literature, because they make sense naturally.  However, their presence in current proof assistants is relatively null.  One day the Dots project hopes to rectify this issue.  After all, many proof assistant syntaxes could make a lot more sense to the human reader if dots were allowed.  How to effectively incorperate dots into proof assistants is an active area of research. Hence the name.
